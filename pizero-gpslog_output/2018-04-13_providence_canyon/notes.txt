Providence Canyon, GA - 2018-04-13 with Sita

temperature started around 60F in the morning, got to about 80F

I drank ~16oz of water on the drive out.
I brought 3L of water in the Platypus and drank about 1L of it. Though I was quite thirsty back at the car and chugged a 28oz Gatorade from the first gas station.

Sita drank ~10oz. She wouldn't drink until near the end.

I brought 2x 1.5c meals for Sita. She wouldn't eat when we got there, and barely ate any lunch.

For myself I brought a Boar's Head Salami D'Oro, 1/2 lb smoked gruyere, and a good size chunk of a baguette. I ate about 1/3 of each for lunch.

I also brought 1 lb trail mix, 5x clif bars, and some beef jerky. I ate one of the Clif bars on the drive out, and maybe 3 handfuls of the trail mix on the hike.

Early in the hike I could feel blisters forming on the balls of my feet and stopped to apply some moleskin. That was the right idea, and I didn't get any blisters. *However* at around mile 2 my feet started hurting pretty badly, and that only got worse. Not from movement, but just from hiking over some portions of really hard clay surface. I think I need gel insoles for my hiking boots.
